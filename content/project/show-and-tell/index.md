This is the deep learning course final project trying to reporduce the results reported in the paper, [Show and Tell: A Neural Image Caption Generator](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf).

The model is trained on the [MS coco2014 dataset](http://cocodataset.org/#home). Our final result looks like
