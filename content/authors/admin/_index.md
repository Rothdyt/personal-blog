I am currently a Ph.D. student in Lehigh's Industrial and Systems Engineering (ISE) Department.

I earned my master degree in the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. During the master study, I also worked as a part-time Data Scientist at Bud Analytics Lab of Anheuser-Busch InBev, focusing on developing data research and innovation.--->
