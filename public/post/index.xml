Problem Formulation There are commonly two ways of formulating the logistic regression problem, depending on the way we label the response variable $y$. Here we focus on the first formulation and defer the second formulation on the appendix.
First Formulation:
Consider restrict $y$ to {${-1,1}$}. Then we have $$ \begin{aligned} &amp;amp;\mathbb{P}(y=1|z)=\sigma(z)=\frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}
&amp;amp;\mathbb{P}(y=-1|z)=\sigma(z)=\frac{1}{1 + e^z}, \end{aligned} $$ which can be compactly written as $$ \mathbb{P}(y|z)=\sigma(zy).</description>

      <description>Point Anomaly Detection - Grubbs’ test Grubbs’ test1 is commonly used technique to detect an outlier in univariate problem, where normality assumption is required. It can be formualted as either one-side testing problem or two-sided testing problem.
The hypothesis test is defined as
\[H_0: \text{There are no outlier in the data set} \quad H_1: \text{There is exactly one outlier in the data set}.\] For two-sided testing, it tries to determine whether the observation with the largest absolute deviation is an outlier, where the test statistic is defined as</description>
